            Monsters inc was a movie based on monsters that needed to scare kids to make sure they never ran out of energy. They also made a movie for the days of their college. that movie was to show they can actually scare. Then they actually ended up failing and had to all of the low jobs before achieving their ultimate goal of doing their favorite job!
